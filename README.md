# Predicting-Bilateral-Trade-Volumes-Between-Nations
This repository contains both historical trade and economic data, as well as an exploration of the ability to predict trade flows between nations based on underlying economic characteristics.

International trade is a core attribute of global economic research that seeks to understand bilateral trade flows based on the economy, demographics, and historical characteristics of each nation. 

Many economists have developed models based on factors like distance between and relative size of trading partners, but there are many other factors that can be explored in combination with machine learning techniques in order to predict future trade flows.
